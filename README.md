### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently working at PlusClouds as a Frontend developer & Project manager.

I mostly worked as a backend developer and most recently worked at a .Net Core - microservice firm that provides high-traffic email services. (at INBOX)

Before this company, I started as a backend developer in a project where instant bids and car auctions were made, and gained experience in bidding infrastructure with node.js and continued as a team leader. (at Dreams&Bytes)

In general, I like to be at every stage of my work. The biggest advantage of this for me is that I can work in all areas of the project from the analysis phase to the last moment, and I can make an error-free and result-oriented work with my knowledge and experience on the subject.

Happy days!
