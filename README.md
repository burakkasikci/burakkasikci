## Hi 👋

I’m Burak — a software developer with hands-on experience across development, databases, and team leadership.

- Coding since ~2004 (started with Turbo Pascal).
- Comfortable across the stack; I focus on solid algorithms over labels.
- Background in both engineering and management.
- I follow best practices, but I’m pragmatic when real-world constraints apply.
